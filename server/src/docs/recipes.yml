Get a list of recipes based on ingredients.
**Example API call**:  `https://reverserecipes.azurewebsites.net/recipes?filter=all`

See below for an example of the required body of a request.


**Note about the API response, containing an array of recipes**

The array of recipes is sorted by the ratio calculated by `num_ingredients_matched / total_num_ingredients`.

With this, recipes that are most suited for a list of ingredients a user has are at the top. If the optional query parameter is used, then the ratio should be 1 for every recipe in the array, i.e., user has every ingredient for that recipe.
