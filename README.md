# cse403-reverse-recipes

Project Idea: 

We aim to create an android app that allows users to select ingredients they have lying around the house and look through recipes that match up with the ingredients they inputed. We also aim to program the app to suggest alternative ingredients for the user if they don't have an ingredient for a recipe. 


Navigating the Repo:

Our repository includes folders for the server side of the app along with the frontend (App) side of the application.
