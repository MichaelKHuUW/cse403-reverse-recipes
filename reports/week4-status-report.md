# Week 4 Status Report 
## Team Report
### Last week’s plans and goals
- App designer (Michael S): Finish app prototype (04/20)
- Web server developers (Raul, Bryce, Han): Implement crawler algorithm (04/22)
- App developers (Michael H, Meitong): Implement search prototype (04/22)
### Progress and issues
- We researched web scraping technologies, deciding to use [Python package for scraping recipes](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers).
- We created a prototype of the app’s user interface.
- We set up a Microsoft Azure server for the app backend.
### Plans and goals
- App designer (Michael S): Finalize search and results pages (04/25)
- Web server developers (Raul, Bryce, Han): Implement crawler algorithm (04/22)
- App developers (Michael H, Meitong): Implement search prototype (04/22)
### Project Meeting Agenda
- Discuss software toolsets/technology - recipe scraper library
- App integration with database
- Any remaining questions from team members

## Contribution of individual team members
### Last week’s plans and goals
- Michael S:
  - Begin sketches/prototyping app interfaces
- Raul:
  - Understand how web crawling works, and try to design an algorithm that would work for our application.
- Bryce:
  - I plan on researching web crawling to get a better understanding since it is new to me
- Han:
  - Learn what a web crawler is
- Michael H:
  - Prototype app interface, querying a local database
- Meitong:
  - Research on how to do the search function on Android Studio
### Progress and issues
- Michael S:
   - Created a simple app interface on Figma
- Raul:
  - Set up a database server which maps ingredients to recipe links. Also looked through the Python library that we are going to use to populate the database. Devised an overall design for how the server will interact with the crawler algorithm and the mobile application. Efficiency of this design is untested.
- Bryce:
  - Did research on a python library that will help with recipe scraping off websites. One issue I anticipate is using this library to automate the scraping process.
- Han: 
  - Learned what a web crawler and researched libraries already out there. Still confused on the data model once we have scraped all the recipes.
- Michael H:
  - Installed necessary development software for app development.
- Meitong:
  - Decided on which development environment to use and did research on how to connect database to android studio
### Plans and goals
- Michael S:
  - Begin sketches/prototyping app interfaces
- Raul:
  - Implementing a way to use the python library to populate the database server. Thinking more about how to use the database to efficiently get recipe links given a set of ingredients.
- Bryce:
  - Begin development/setting up of necessary tools for server and web crawling, and learn about types of databases we can use. Finalize software architecture.
- Han:
  - Set up development environment and play around with the Python tool the team found
- Michael H:
  - Implement prototype app interface by Michael Sy, query a local database
- Meitong:
  - Familiarize myself with all the functions in android studio and implement UI
