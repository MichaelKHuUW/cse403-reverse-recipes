# User Manual

## High-level Product Description: 

Reverse Recipes is an Android app that allows users to select ingredients they have lying around the house in the app and find unique recipes that match up with the ingredients they input.

This app helps give users creative recipe ideas using ingredients they may not know what to make of. It will also help save the user money by giving them an option to utilize the random ingredients lying around their house instead of letting it go to waste.
